Here, I would like to share some GATE preparation tips and guidelines for truly aspired candidates. Read all the guidelines carefully. It is likely that some guidelines might be inconvenient for you to follow, in that case, you should rather find alternatives or way outs on yourself.


( 1 ) In addition to the IISc/IITs/NITs, GATE preparation will also be useful indirectly to get an admission into top institutes like IIIT-Hyderabad, BITS-Pilani, VIT, etc.


( 2 ) So, if your'e really aspired to have M.Tech in India's best institutes, then be ready for the following entrance exams:

  GATE ( Feb )	->	PGEE ( Apr )	->	BITS HD Test ( Jun )	-> VITMEE ( Jun )


( 3 ) Have a look at the updated GATE syllabus, because it is what you will be trying to digest until the final day of exam comes.


( 4 ) Make a list of the most preferred textbooks for all the subjects for your branch and get that somehow ( either purchase hard books or download eBooks for your eBook reader ).


( 5 ) In previous post, I've suggested textbooks for Computer Science branch. For any other branch you can search it on Google or refer to some previous GATE toppers of your branch.


( 6 ) It is advisable that you do not go for any shortcut GATE preparation material, as it is likely to be error-prone and hence it is not effective way of GATE preparation. So, always stick to the standard and the most preferred textbooks.


( 7 ) Have your own strategy to the following stuff beforehand:

	* Way of preparation, possible options are:

		- Textbooks
		- Internet
		- Group / Individual preparation

	* Reading / Practice schedule for various subjects

	* Adjustment with your current job or study

	* How to improve your Speed and Accuracy?

	* How to overcome your Fear, Anxiety, Boredom and Lack of Concentration from time to time?

	* Final day ( actual exam day ) strategy


( 8 ) Since the very first day of your GATE preparation, make separate notebooks for all the subjects ( including General Aptitude section as well ).


( 9 ) Have a look at some useful notebook making tips:

	Divide every notebook into following sections:

		* Index for some important topics ( i.e. topic name to page number )

		* Definitions or Glossary

		* Chapters ( i.e. Group similar topics under same chapter )

		* Formulas

		* Problems & Solutions

		* TO DO List : It contains the list of unsolved problems and topics which need to be explored or cleared in near by future


( 10 ) Notebooks made as per above instructions will help you revise subjects from time to time.


( 11 ) Have a look at some of the tips regarding the order of subject preparation:

	* It is advisble to start your GATE preparation with Maths, because it might come in your way while preparing other subjects

	* However, you could start GATE preparation by your own interesting subjects

	* If possible, don't prepare everything concurrently, because it might cause tension to you


( 12 ) For preparation of Genral Aptitude section, you could prepare it on regular basis by practising different types of problems from the suggested books.


( 13 ) To secure maximum marks in the English part of the General Aptitude section, very first thing you need to work on is enhancing your vocabulary by various words.

	* For tips on this, please visit following website:

( 14 ) Once you know many important words, you will feel very comfortable in reading and solving GATE questions ( especially English part ).


( 15 ) As and when you find out or come across some unknown word, you could note down that new word with its meaning in your English notebook.


( 16 ) If you are interested in some other subject ( out of GATE syllabus ), then feel free and continue reading that one, because that activity will bring more interest towards GATE subjects indirectly and it'll also increase your level of concentration and determination for specific subject.


( 17 ) Have a cheerful mind before starting to read or practise anything new. So, don't read or practise anything new while your'e mentally disturbed, because preparation under such circumstances won't have any effect on your level of knowledge.


( 18 ) As and when you learn any new topic, it must be applied somehow to get full confidence on that topic ( i.e. solve textbook examples/excercises and previous GATE questions related to that topic ).


( 19 ) Once you learn anything very hard or important stuff, please feel free to discuss it with your friends ( those who are also preparing for GATE and better understand you ). I mean, celebrate your small achievments. Because, some day, that small achievment will be a part of your big success!


( 20 ) Hardly skip anything from any subject or else it'll cost you a lot on final day.


( 21 ) Practising different types of problems for the same topic will be beneficial, because it will...

	* Diminish the doubts and increase the clarity of mind and hence level of confidence
	* Decrease the numbers of silly mistakes that you usually make
	* Increase the overall speed


( 22 ) Be familiar with your own scientific calculator and its useful functionalities.


( 23 ) You can make use of Facebook as a complimentary preparation option. For that, you could join some well-known Groups and visit some Pages related to GATE for posting your queries and getting updated by newer questions on various subjects and topics.


( 24 ) Expertise and clear understanding of your subjects and its concepts will lead you towards your goal.


( 25 ) Once you've got that much expertise on particular subject, difference between Theoritical and Practical Knowledge will become almost zero for that subject.


( 26 ) During GATE preparation, don't have just exam-oriented mindset, but rather have wide perspective towards your career (  i.e. whatever you are going to learn today, will also be useful in current or future endeavours like interviews, job, research, etc. ).


( 27 ) Treat whole GATE project as an important investment towards your career.

( 32 ) Here are some of the guidelines on what to do during the week before an actual GATE exam...


	* Visit your alloted test center and take a Mock GATE test to be familiar with the system

	* Don't look at any new topics during this week

	* However, if there are any doubts in previously seen topics, feel free to clear it before the exam

	* Go through all your notes and revise it carefully

	* Have a self-confidence


( 33 ) Here are some of the guidelines for the day of an actual GATE exam...


	* Reach the alloted test center on time

	* Don't bring any type of reading material with you

	* It's a final day, so be happy in that sense and no need to get worried

	* Also, don't get emotional, be practical!

	* Be mentally prepared to sit there for 3 hours

	* You will be given one ( and  possibly only one ) rough note for scratch work

	* Hence, utilise its space smartly ( So, make very brief and clear notes on it )

	* Read whole question carefully without missing any single detail

	* Identify the subject and topic

	* Decide whether you know it fully or not ( Try to recollect formulas involved )

	* After deciding to attempt the question, extract an important data from the question and write it down on the rough paper

	* Make a dynamic strategy that would lead you towards the correct answer in the least possible time

	* Poissible strategies would be:

		- Straight-forward method which doesn't involve reviewing at any of the given options

		- Method of elimination, in which you have to review the given options against your knowledge and eliminate one or more of them from the set of possible answer choices

		- Method of substitution, in which you have to plug given options one by one into the question itself and find out which one is correct

	* Review all the steps taken to solve the question

	* If you find out any mistake, correct it and get the final answer

	* Now, go through all the given options and select the best one as the final answer

	* Don't forget to look at any of the given options, because there might be other option which is superior than the currently selected one

	* It is very important to read all the questions in given time limit, so that you do not miss easier questions

	* Don't get trapped into any of the confusing question during the exam

	* If it seems very hard or wrong question, please leave it for the sake of other untouched or unsolved questions

	* Also, there will be plenty of other questions to solve

	* It is likely that you get frustrated after solving some of the questions

	* But, this frustration should not affect other upcoming questions

	* In other words, keep every question and its adverse effects into its own blackbox

	* Hence, it is advisable to forget whatever happened till now, before going for a new question
